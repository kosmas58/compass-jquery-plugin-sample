    %h2 Ajax form submission
    %p
      In jQuery Mobile, form submissions are automatically handled using Ajax whenever possible, creating a smooth transition between the form and the result page. To ensure your form submits as intended, be sure to specify
      %code action
      and
      %code method
      properties on your form element. When unspecified, the method will default to
      = succeed "," do
        %code get
      and the
      %code action
      will default to the current page's relative path (found via
      %code $.mobile.path.get()
    %p
      Forms also accept attributes for transitions just like anchors, such as
      %code data-transition="pop"
      and
      = succeed "." do
        %code data-direction="reverse"
      To submit a form without Ajax, you can either disable Ajax form handling globally, or per form via the
      %code data-ajax="false"
      attribute. The
      %code target
      attribute (as in
      = succeed ")" do
        %code target="_blank"
      is respected on forms as well, and will default to the browser's handling of that target when the form submits. Note that unlike anchors, the
      %code rel
      attribute is not allowed on forms.
    %h2 Non-Ajax handling
    %p
      To prevent form submissions from being automatically handled with Ajax, add the
      %code data-ajax="false"
      attribute to the form element. You can also turn of Ajax form handling completely via the
      %code ajaxFormsEnabled
      = succeed "." do
        %a{:href => "/mobile/docs/api/globalconfig"} global config option
    %h2 Simple Ajax form example
    %p
      This page demonstrates automated ajax handling of form submissions. The form below is configured to send regular a
      %code get
      request to
      = succeed "." do
        %code forms-sample-response.php
      On submit, jQuery Mobile will make sure that the Url specified is able to be retrieved via Ajax, and handle it appropriately. Keep in mind that just like ordinary HTTP form submissions, jQuery Mobile allows
      %code get
      result pages to be bookmarked by updating the Url hash when the response returns successfully. Also like ordinary form submissions,
      %code post
      requests do not contain query parameters in the hash, so they are not bookmarkable.
