      %p.ui-body This page demonstrates the "fullscreen" toolbar mode. This toolbar treatment is used in special cases where you want the content to fill the whole screen, and you want the header and footer toolbars to appear and disappear when the page is clicked responsively &mdash; a common scenario for photo, image or video viewers.
      %p.ui-body
        To enable this toolbar feature type, you apply a
        %code data-fullscreen="true"
        attribute to the
        %code div
        contain that has the attribute
        = succeed "," do
          %code data-role="page"
        and the
        %code data-position="fixed"
        attribute to both the header and footer
        %code div
        elements.
      %p.ui-body
        Keep in mind that the toolbars in this mode will sit
        %strong over
        page content, so not all content will be accessible with the toolbars open, just as shown in this demo.
  %div{"data-position" => "fixed", "data-role" => "footer"}
    %h1 Fullscreen fixed footer
