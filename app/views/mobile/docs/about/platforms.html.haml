    %h2 Supported platforms in Beta 1
    %p To provide a quick summary of our browser support in Beta 1, we’ve created a simple A (full), B (full minus Ajax), C (basic) grade system with notes of the actual devices and versions we’ve been testing on in our lab. The visual fidelity of the experience is highly dependent on CSS rendering capabilities of the device and platform so not all A grade experience will be pixel-perfect.
    %h3{:style => "display: block; font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal; background: #fff; border-left: 7px solid #74B64A; padding: 5px 0 5px 8px;"}
      %strong A-grade
      \- Full enhanced experience with Ajax-based animated page transitions.

    %p Since jQuery Mobile is built on the jQuery core, all pages should also work great on most recent versions of desktop browsers too - Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Opera, etc.
