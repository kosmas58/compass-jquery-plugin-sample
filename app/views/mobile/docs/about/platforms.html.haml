      %h2#platforms Platform support in Beta 3
      %p As of Beta 3, we've pretty much covered our target platforms for 1.0. At this stage, jQuery Mobile works on the vast majority of all modern desktop, smartphone, tablet, and e-reader platforms. In addition, feature phones and older browsers are also supported because of our progressive enhancement approach. We're very proud of our commitment to universal accessibility through our broad support for all popular platforms.
      %p
        Our
        %a{:href => "http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/"} graded support matrix
        was created over a year ago based on our goals as a project and since that time, we've been refining our grading system based on real-world device testing and the quickly evolving mobile landscape. To provide a quick summary of our browser support in Beta 1, we've created a simple A (full), B (full minus Ajax), C (basic) grade system with notes of the actual devices and versions we've been testing on in our lab.
      %p The visual fidelity of the experience is highly dependent on CSS rendering capabilities of the device and platform so not all A grade experience will be pixel-perfect but that's the nature of the web. We'll be adding additional vendor-prefixed CSS rules to bring transitions, gradients and other visual improvements to non-WebKit browsers in future releases so look for even more added visual polish as we move towards 1.0.
