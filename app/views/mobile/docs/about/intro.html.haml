    %h2 jQuery Mobile Overview
    %p jQuery’s mobile strategy can be summarized simply: Delivering top-of-the-line JavaScript in a unified User Interface that works across the most-used smartphone web browsers and tablet form factors.
    %p
      The critical difference with our approach is the
      %a{:href => "/mobile/docs/about/platforms"} wide variety of mobile platforms we’re targeting
      with jQuery Mobile. We’ve been working hard at bringing jQuery support to all mobile browsers that are sufficiently-capable and have at least a nominal amount of market share. In this way, we’re treating mobile web browsers exactly how we treat desktop web browsers.
    %p
      To make this broad support possible, all pages in jQuery Mobile are built on a foundation of
      %strong clean, semantic HTML
      to ensure compatibility with pretty much any web-enabled device. In devices that interpret CSS and JavaScript, jQuery Mobile applies
      %strong progressive enhancement techniques
      to unobtrusively transform the semantic page into a rich, interactive experience that leverages the power of jQuery and CSS.
      %strong Accessibility features
      such as WAI-ARIA are tightly integrated throughout the framework to provide support for screen readers and other assistive technologies.
