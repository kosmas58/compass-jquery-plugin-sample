      jQuery’s mobile strategy can be summarized simply: Delivering top-of-the-line JavaScript in
      a unified User Interface that works across the most-used smartphone web browsers and tablet
      form factors.
    %p
      The critical difference with our approach is the
      %a{:href => "/mobile/docs/about/platforms"}
        wide variety of mobile platforms we’re targeting
      with jQuery Mobile. We’ve been working hard at bringing jQuery support to all mobile browsers
      that are sufficiently-capable and have at least a nominal amount of market share. In this way,
      we’re treating mobile web browsers exactly how we treat desktop web browsers.

      To make this broad support possible, all pages in jQuery Mobile are built on a foundation of
      %strong
        clean, semantic HTML
      to ensure compatibility with pretty much any web-enabled device. In devices that interpret CSS
      and JavaScript, jQuery Mobile applies
      %strong
        progressive enhancement techniques
      to unobtrusively transform the semantic page into a rich, interactive experience that leverages
      the power of jQuery and CSS.
      %strong
        Accessibility features
      such as WAI-ARIA are tightly integrated throughout the framework to provide support for screen
      readers and other assistive technologies.
