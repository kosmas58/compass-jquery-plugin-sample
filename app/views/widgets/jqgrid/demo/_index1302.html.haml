    This sample demonstrates the new rendering engine of jqGrid. In the versions before 3.5 beta jqGrid
    rendered big data sets slowly. This is changed in 3.5 beta. By default jqGrid renders data 3-5 times
    faster compared with previous releases, but there is a bit more. When we use the option griedview set
    to true it is possibe to speed the reading process by 5-10 times. This is achieved by reading the data
    at once. This mode has some limitations - it is not possible to use treeGrid, subGrid and afterInsertRow
    (event). Enjoy the speed!
