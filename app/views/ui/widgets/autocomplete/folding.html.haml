  %p
    The autocomplete field uses a custom source option which will match results that have accented
    characters even when the text field doesn't contain accented characters. However if the you type
    in accented characters in the text field it is smart enough not to show results that aren't accented.

  %p
    Try typing "Jo" to see "John" and "Jörn", then type "Jö" to see only "Jörn".
